**State Farm 2024 Research Park Hack Day: Playlistify**

Our plan for this project was to create a way for people to connect over music on Spotify. Given that Spotify does not have many social features, we decided this was best achieved by making it easier for users to find public **user created** playlists that match their music tastes. 

After designing an algorithm, we had trouble connecting our front end to our backend and ran out of time to finish the project in its entirety.

Because of this, our final product includes a front end with little else. We also ran out of time to record a video so this completes our submission.
